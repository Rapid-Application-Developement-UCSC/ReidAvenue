# Developement

The server part of this app user two third party services, namely "ImageKit" an mongodb, so the required keys have to be supplied.We have included a example env file but you'll have to create accounts in those ervices and use your own api keys to run this application locally.ALso you need to install mkcert and setup a certificte server because express part uses https to make sure that cookies are secure
